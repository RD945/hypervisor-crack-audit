## 1. Executive Summary

This package is a **game piracy crack** for "Resident Evil Requiem" (Steam AppId 3764200). It bypasses a 5-layer DRM stack:

> **Steam + Denuvo Anti-Tamper + Capcom Anti-Tamper + VMProtect + SteamStub**

The crack operates across **four CPU privilege levels** simultaneously:

| Layer | Ring Level | Component | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| UEFI Firmware | Ring -2 | EfiGuard (EfiGuardDxe.efi) | Disables PatchGuard + Driver Signature Enforcement at boot |
| Hypervisor | Ring -1 | SimpleSvm.sys | Intercepts CPUID/MSR to spoof environment for Denuvo |
| Kernel | Ring 0 | hyperkd.sys | KUSER_SHARED_DATA spoofing, orchestrates hypervisor |
| User Mode | Ring 3 | ColdClientLoader + Goldberg Emu | Replaces Steam client, emulates Steamworks API |

**Verdict:** Not general-purpose malware. Every component has a specific DRM-bypass function. However, `hyperkd.sys` is **closed-source, unsigned, ring-0** code from an anonymous group -- it carries inherent risk. The package also **disables critical Windows security features** (DSE, PatchGuard), leaving the system vulnerable to other threats while active.

### PE Header Analysis of Binary Files

| Binary | Architecture | Subsystem | PE Characteristics |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `hyperkd.sys` | x86-64 (0x8664) | Native/Kernel (1) | 0x0022 (Executable, Large Address Aware) |
| `SimpleSvm.sys` | x86-64 (0x8664) | Native/Kernel (1) | 0x0022 (Executable, Large Address Aware) |
| `steamclient.dll` | x86 (0x014C) | Windows GUI (2) | 0x2102 (DLL, Executable, 32-bit) |
| `steamclient64.dll` | x86-64 (0x8664) | Windows GUI (2) | 0x2022 (DLL, Executable, Large Address Aware) |
| `GameOverlayRenderer64.dll` | x86-64 (0x8664) | Windows GUI (2) | 0x2022 (DLL, Executable, Large Address Aware) |
| `amd_ags_x64.org` | x86-64 (0x8664) | Windows Console (3) | 0x2022 (DLL, Executable, Large Address Aware) |

**Key observation:** Both `.sys` files have Subsystem = 1 (Native), confirming they are legitimate Windows kernel drivers, not user-mode executables disguised with `.sys` extensions. Their PE characteristics (0x0022) indicate they are not DLLs -- they are standalone kernel executables.

## 3. How Denuvo Anti-Tamper Works

Denuvo is a commercial anti-tamper technology by Denuvo Software Solutions GmbH (now owned by Irdeto). It is NOT a standalone DRM -- it is an **anti-tamper wrapper** that protects other DRM (here: Steam + Capcom's own DRM).

### 3.1 Denuvo's Protection Mechanisms

**Code Virtualization:**
- Critical game functions are converted from native x86-64 instructions into custom bytecode
- This bytecode runs inside a private virtual machine (VM) embedded in the game executable
- VMProtect adds an additional layer of VM-based obfuscation on top of Denuvo's own VM
- Result: Static disassembly (IDA Pro, Ghidra) shows gibberish -- the real logic is hidden inside VM interpreters

**Hardware-Bound Token System:**
- At specific trigger points during gameplay, Denuvo contacts online activation servers
- The server issues a time-limited **hardware-fingerprinted token** bound to:
   - CPU ID (CPUID instruction results)
   - Disk serial numbers
   - Windows installation ID
   - Motherboard identifiers
- These tokens are checked at runtime; without valid tokens, protected code blocks fail

**Anti-Analysis Detection (what the hypervisor must defeat):**

| Detection Method | What Denuvo Checks | How It Checks |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Hypervisor detection | Is a hypervisor running? | `CPUID` leaf 0x1, ECX bit 31 (hypervisor-present bit) |
| CPU vendor verification | Is this a real CPU? | `CPUID` leaf 0x0 vendor string (must be `AuthenticAMD` or `GenuineIntel`) |
| Debugger detection | Is a debugger attached? | `IsDebuggerPresent()`, `NtQueryInformationProcess`, timing attacks |
| Timing checks | Is execution being single-stepped? | `RDTSC`/`RDTSCP` timing deltas between code blocks |
| KUSER_SHARED_DATA | Is the OS environment normal? | Reads from fixed address `0x7FFE0000` -- contains OS version, tick count, system flags |
| Self-integrity | Has Denuvo's own code been patched? | CRC/hash checks over its own memory regions |
| Environment flags | Are security features normal? | Checks various system settings, driver presence, etc. |
| KdDebuggerNotPresent | Is kernel debugging active? | Reads `nt!KdDebuggerNotPresent` global variable |

### 3.2 Why Conventional Cracks Don't Work on Modern Denuvo

Traditional game cracking = find the DRM check, NOP it out or patch the jump. With Denuvo + VMProtect:
- The check logic is **inside a custom VM** -- you can't just patch a `JNZ` to `JMP`
- There are **hundreds of trigger points** scattered through the game, not a single check
- The code **self-verifies** -- patching one check triggers integrity failures in others
- Server-generated tokens are **unique per hardware** -- you can't just copy someone else's

**This is why the hypervisor approach exists:** Instead of trying to patch Denuvo (nearly impossible with VMProtect layering), you **spoof the entire environment from below** so Denuvo's checks all pass with legitimate-looking results.

---

## 4. How This Package Defeats Denuvo -- The Full Attack Chain

The crack uses a layered interception architecture where each ring level handles specific Denuvo defenses. The layers are described from highest privilege (deepest) to lowest:

At the deepest level, Ring -2 (UEFI Firmware), EfiGuard (EfiGuardDxe.efi) operates before Windows even boots. It defeats Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) so that unsigned kernel drivers can load without being blocked. It also defeats PatchGuard, which would otherwise detect kernel modifications and cause a blue screen. Without this layer, neither hyperkd.sys nor SimpleSvm.sys could load at all.

One level up, at Ring -1 (Hypervisor), SimpleSvm.sys uses AMD SVM (Secure Virtual Machine) hardware virtualization to place the entire operating system inside a virtual machine that it controls. From this position it intercepts CPUID instructions so Denuvo cannot detect a hypervisor is running. It also intercepts RDTSC timing reads to return consistent values that hide debugging or single-stepping. MSR (Model Specific Register) queries are similarly handled to prevent environment detection.

At Ring 0 (Kernel), hyperkd.sys is the orchestrator. It spoofs KUSER_SHARED_DATA (a shared kernel/user memory page at address 0x7FFE0000) to make the OS environment appear completely normal to Denuvo. It also manages the lifecycle of SimpleSvm.sys, starting and stopping the hypervisor as needed, and patches the KdDebuggerNotPresent kernel variable so Denuvo cannot detect a kernel debugger.

Finally, at Ring 3 (User Mode), ColdClientLoader launches the game executable (re9.exe) with the Goldberg Steam Emulator DLLs in place of the real Steam client. This defeats Steam authentication and SteamStub by responding to all Steamworks API calls locally, reporting the game as legitimately owned and running in offline mode.

### The Interception Flow for a Denuvo Check

When Denuvo executes a check inside the game process:

1. **Denuvo calls `CPUID`** to check if a hypervisor is present
   - SimpleSvm.sys **intercepts** this at ring -1
   - Returns modified results: clears the hypervisor-present bit, returns `AuthenticAMD` vendor string
   - Denuvo sees: "No hypervisor, real AMD CPU"

2. **Denuvo reads `KUSER_SHARED_DATA`** at `0x7FFE0000`
   - hyperkd.sys has **spoofed the values** in kernel memory
   - Denuvo sees: "Normal Windows environment"

3. **Denuvo calls `RDTSC`** for timing checks
   - SimpleSvm.sys can intercept TSC reads via VMCB control bits
   - Returns consistent timing values that don't indicate single-stepping

4. **Denuvo checks `KdDebuggerNotPresent`**
   - hyperkd.sys patches this kernel variable
   - Denuvo sees: "No kernel debugger attached"

5. **Denuvo validates its Steam integration**
   - Goldberg emulator's `steamclient64.dll` responds to all ISteam* API calls
   - Returns valid-looking app ownership, user identity, ticket data

6. **Denuvo's unsigned driver checks would normally trigger PatchGuard BSOD**
   - EfiGuard disabled PatchGuard at boot time
   - System remains stable despite kernel modifications

## 5. EfiGuard -- UEFI Bootkit (Ring -2)

**Source:** Open-source, GPL-3.0 -- [github.com/Mattiwatti/EfiGuard](https://github.com/Mattiwatti/EfiGuard)
**Author:** Mattiwatti (Matthijs Lavrijsen)
**Stars:** 2,300+ on GitHub
**Purpose:** Disable PatchGuard and Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) at boot time

### 5.1 Files in the EfiGuard Folder

| File | Size | Date | Role |
|------|------|------|------|
| `bootx64.efi` | 101,160 bytes | 2024-01-08 | Renamed `Loader.efi` -- the UEFI boot application that starts the chain |
| `EfiGuardDxe.efi` | 360,448 bytes | 2026-01-27 | The core UEFI DXE driver that performs all kernel patches |
| `loader.efi` | 49,152 bytes | 2026-01-27 | Redundant copy of the loader application |
| `HashTool.efi` | 100,656 bytes | 2024-01-08 | Optional Secure Boot hash enrollment utility |

### 5.2 What EfiGuard Does -- Stage by Stage

EfiGuard operates in the UEFI DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase -- this is **before the Windows kernel even loads**. It patches Windows components as they are loaded by the firmware.

**Stage 1 -- Boot Manager Patch (`bootmgfw.efi`):**

Strings found in `EfiGuardDxe.efi` confirming this:
`
[ bootmgfw!ImgArchStartBootApplication ]
Patched bootmgfw!ImgpValidateImageHash [RVA: 0x%X]
Patched bootmgfw!ImgpFilterValidationFailure [RVA: 0x%X]
`

- Hooks `ImgArchStartBootApplication` in the Windows Boot Manager
- Patches `ImgpValidateImageHash` -- this is the function that validates the cryptographic hash of boot images. By patching it, EfiGuard allows modified bootloaders and kernels to load
- Patches `ImgpFilterValidationFailure` -- this function reports integrity violations to the TPM or SI log. Patching it prevents any audit trail

**Stage 2 -- Boot Loader Patch (`winload.efi`):**

Strings found:
`
Patching winload.efi v%u.%u.%u.%u...
Found OslFwpKernelSetupPhase1 at 0x%llX
Successfully patched winload!OslFwpKernelSetupPhase1
VbsPolicyDisabled
`

- Hooks `OslFwpKernelSetupPhase1` -- the last function in winload that runs before the kernel takes over, while EFI boot services are still available
- Can disable VBS (Virtualization Based Security) by setting the `VbsPolicyDisabled` EFI runtime variable

**Stage 3 -- Kernel Patch (`ntoskrnl.exe`) -- PatchGuard Disable:**

Strings found confirming each PatchGuard component patched:
`
[PatchNtoskrnl] Disabling PatchGuard... [INIT RVA: 0x%X - 0x%X]
Patched KeInitAmd64SpecificState [RVA: 0x%X]
Found CcInitializeBcbProfiler pattern at 0x%llX
Patched ExpLicenseWatchInitWorker [RVA: 0x%X]
Patched g_PgContext [RVA: 0x%X]
Patched KiSwInterrupt [RVA: 0x%X]
Patched KiVerifyScopesExecute [RVA: 0x%X]
Patched KiMcaDeferredRecoveryService [RVAs: 0x%X, 0x%X]
[PatchNtoskrnl] Successfully disabled PatchGuard.
`

What each patch does:

| Patch Target | What It Is | Why It's Patched |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `KeInitAmd64SpecificState` | Triggers a deliberate #DE (divide error) that initializes PatchGuard's timer-based verification system | Prevents PG from starting its periodic kernel integrity checks |
| `CcInitializeBcbProfiler` | Allocates the large PatchGuard context structure (~400KB) that holds all monitored addresses | Without this allocation, PG has no data structure to work with |
| `ExpLicenseWatchInitWorker` | A PG initialization entry point disguised as a licensing function | Prevents one of PG's hidden initialization paths from executing |
| `g_PgContext` | The global pointer to PatchGuard's monitoring context | Nullified so PG's verification routines find no context to check |
| `KiSwInterrupt` | A PG verification trigger hidden in the software interrupt handler | Prevents PG checks from being triggered via interrupt 0x29 |
| `KiVerifyScopesExecute` | A PG verification routine that checks kernel code integrity | Prevents runtime integrity verification of kernel pages |
| `KiMcaDeferredRecoveryService` | PG trigger hidden in the Machine Check Architecture error handler | Prevents PG checks from firing on hardware error recovery paths |

**Stage 3b -- Kernel Patch -- DSE (Driver Signature Enforcement) Disable:**

Strings found:
`
[PatchNtoskrnl] Successfully disabled DSE.
Found 'mov ecx, xxx' in SepInitializeCodeIntegrity [RVA: 0x%X]
Found 'cmp g_CiEnabled, al' in SeValidateImageData [RVA: 0x%X]
Patched SeCodeIntegrityQueryInformation [RVA: 0x%X]
Found g_CiEnabled at 0x%llX
Failed to find IAT address of CI.dll!CiInitialize
Hooked gRT->SetVariable: 0x%p -> 0x%p
`

EfiGuard offers two DSE bypass methods:

**Method 1 -- Boot-time DSE disable:**
- Patches `SepInitializeCodeIntegrity` -- replaces `mov ecx, <value>` with `xor ecx, ecx` so Code Integrity initializes in a disabled state
- Patches `SeValidateImageData` -- replaces the function's return value with `mov eax, 0` (STATUS_SUCCESS) so all image validation passes
- Patches `SeCodeIntegrityQueryInformation` -- so if any process queries whether CI is enabled, it still reports "enabled" (stealth)

**Method 2 -- SetVariable hook (DEFAULT):**
- Hooks the UEFI Runtime Service `SetVariable()`
- After boot, the companion `EfiDSEFix.exe` calls `NtSetSystemEnvironmentValueEx` with a special GUID
- This tunnels through the UEFI runtime service hook into kernel memory
- Allows setting `g_CiEnabled` / `g_CiOptions` to any value from user mode -- effectively an arbitrary kernel read/write backdoor
- The string `roodkcaBdrauGifE` found in the binary is "EfiGuardBackdoor" reversed -- this is the marker GUID name

### 5.3 Why EfiGuard Is Necessary for This Crack

Without EfiGuard:
- `hyperkd.sys` and `SimpleSvm.sys` are **unsigned kernel drivers** -- Windows refuses to load them (DSE blocks it)
- Even if you force-load them via test signing, **PatchGuard** detects the kernel modifications made by `hyperkd.sys` and triggers a BSOD within minutes
- EfiGuard solves both: DSE off = drivers load, PatchGuard off = no BSOD from kernel modifications

**The NFO file confirms this:** *"Or you can use EfiGuard to avoid disabling all of them <3, it's easy and quick."*

### 5.4 EfiGuard Limitations

The `EfiGuardDxe.efi` strings also reveal:
`
[PatchNtoskrnl] ERROR: Checked kernels are not supported.
[PatchNtoskrnl] ERROR: Unsupported kernel image version.
`

- Cannot bypass **HVCI** (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity / HyperGuard) -- this runs at VTL1, a higher privilege than even the UEFI bootkit
- Only supports retail (free) kernels, not checked/debug kernels
- Requires Secure Boot to be disabled (unless you own the Platform Key)

## 6. SimpleSvm.sys -- AMD Hypervisor (Ring -1)

**Source:** Open-source, MIT License -- [github.com/tandasat/SimpleSvm](https://github.com/tandasat/SimpleSvm)
**Author:** Satoshi Tanda (security researcher)
**Stars:** 534 on GitHub
**Binary Size:** 17,776 bytes
**PE Subsystem:** Native/Kernel (Subsystem = 1)
**Architecture:** x86-64 (Machine = 0x8664)

### 6.1 What SimpleSvm Is

SimpleSvm is described by its author as *"a minimalistic educational hypervisor for Windows on AMD processors."* It uses AMD's **Secure Virtual Machine (SVM)** hardware extension (AMD's equivalent of Intel VT-x) to turn the existing running OS into a **guest virtual machine** while SimpleSvm itself runs at ring -1 as the hypervisor.

### 6.2 Strings Extracted from SimpleSvm.sys -- Full Analysis

**Lifecycle/Status Messages:**
`
Attempting to virtualize the processor.
The processor has been virtualized.
The processor has been de-virtualized.
SVM is not fully supported on this processor.
Failed to open the power state callback object.
Failed to register a power state callback.
Insufficient memory.
`

These confirm the standard SimpleSvm lifecycle: check CPU support -- virtualize -- handle power events -- devirtualize on unload.

**CPU Vendor Verification Strings:**
`
AuthenticAMD (split as: ??cAMD, ??E???Auth, ??enti)
A?SSVM (CPUID check for SVM feature)
SimpleSvm (hypervisor vendor string returned via CPUID)
`

When SimpleSvm intercepts `CPUID` leaf 0x40000000 (hypervisor vendor), it returns `"SimpleSvm "` as the vendor ID. However, for Denuvo bypass, the CPUID intercept for leaf 0x1 must **clear bit 31 of ECX** (the hypervisor-present flag) so Denuvo doesn't detect it.

**Kernel API Imports (confirmed via strings):**
`
ntoskrnl.exe -- links to the Windows kernel
ExAllocatePool2 -- allocates kernel memory (modern API, Win10+)
ExFreePoolWithTag -- frees kernel memory
ExCreateCallback -- creates callback objects
ExRegisterCallback -- registers for system callbacks
ExUnregisterCallback -- unregisters callbacks
IoAllocateMdl -- allocates Memory Descriptor Lists (for DMA/mapping)
IoGetCurrentProcess -- gets current process context
KeGetCurrentIrql -- checks current interrupt level
KeQueryActiveProcessorCountEx -- counts active CPU cores
KeSetSystemGroupAffinityThread -- pins thread to specific CPU core
KeRevertToUserGroupAffinityThread -- reverts CPU affinity
KeWaitForSingleObject -- synchronization primitive
KeDelayExecutionThread -- sleep
KeBugCheck -- triggers BSOD (used as last resort on critical failure)
KfRaiseIrql -- raises interrupt priority
KeLowerIrql -- lowers interrupt priority
KeGetProcessorNumberFromIndex -- maps processor index to number
MmAllocateContiguousNodeMemory -- allocates physically contiguous memory (for VMCB)
MmFreeContiguousMemory -- frees contiguous memory
MmGetPhysicalAddress -- converts virtual to physical address
MmGetVirtualForPhysical -- converts physical to virtual address
MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache -- maps physical pages into virtual address space
MmProbeAndLockPages -- locks pages in physical memory
MmUnlockPages -- unlocks pages
MmUnmapLockedPages -- unmaps previously mapped pages
RtlCaptureContext -- captures current CPU register state (used to populate VMCB)
RtlGetVersion -- gets Windows version info
RtlInitializeBitMap -- initializes bitmap structure
RtlSetBits / RtlClearAllBits -- bitmap manipulation
ObfDereferenceObject -- dereferences kernel object
ObReferenceObjectByHandle -- references kernel object by handle
ZwClose -- closes kernel handle
strcmp -- string comparison

`

**Key observations from the API imports:**
- `MmAllocateContiguousNodeMemory` -- AMD SVM requires the VMCB (Virtual Machine Control Block) and host state save area to be in **physically contiguous memory**. This is the allocation function used for that.
- `RtlCaptureContext` -- Used to capture the current CPU state (all registers) to populate the VMCB's guest state. This is how SimpleSvm "snapshots" the running OS state before virtualizing it.
- `KeSetSystemGroupAffinityThread` -- SimpleSvm must run its virtualization code on **every CPU core individually**, so it pins its thread to each core in sequence.
- `KeBugCheck` -- If something goes critically wrong during virtualization, it BSODs rather than leaving the system in a corrupt state.

**KUSER Spoofing Strings (MODIFIED from original SimpleSvm):**
`
Failed to LookupProcessByProcessId, can not spoof KUSER only for the game process.
Failed to AcquireProcessExitSynchronization, can not spoof KUSER only for the game process.
Failed to create CounterUpdater thread.
`

**These strings DO NOT exist in the original SimpleSvm from GitHub.** They were added by MKDEV TEAM. This reveals:

- This is a **modified version** of SimpleSvm with custom KUSER_SHARED_DATA spoofing code
- It uses `PsLookupProcessByProcessId` to find the game process specifically
- It uses `PsAcquireProcessExitSynchronization` to safely handle game process exit
- The spoofing is **process-specific** -- it only spoofs KUSER data for the game process, not for the entire OS (this is more stealthy)
- A `CounterUpdater` background thread continuously updates spoofed timing values

**Additional Modified SimpleSvm APIs (not in original):**
`
PsCreateSystemThread -- creates kernel threads (for CounterUpdater)
PsLookupProcessByProcessId -- finds process by PID
PsAcquireProcessExitSynchronization -- safe process exit handling
PsReleaseProcessExitSynchronization -- releases exit sync
PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine -- registers for process creation/exit notifications
PsTerminateSystemThread -- terminates kernel thread
PsThreadType -- thread object type reference
KeStackAttachProcess -- attaches to another process's address space
KeUnstackDetachProcess -- detaches from process address space
KdDebuggerNotPresent -- kernel debugger detection variable
`

**Critical finding:** `KdDebuggerNotPresent` is imported -- this is the kernel global variable that indicates whether a kernel debugger is attached. The modified SimpleSvm likely **patches this to always return TRUE** (debugger not present), defeating Denuvo's kernel debugger detection.

**Denuvo-Specific Strings Found:**
`
Denuvo GmbH
Denuvo GmbH0
Denuvo GmbH0?
`

These are certificate/signature strings -- likely from an embedded Denuvo certificate used to identify or validate against Denuvo's token system.

**Unicode Wide Strings:**
`
\Callback\PowerState
`
This is the kernel callback object path used to register for power state changes (sleep/hibernate). SimpleSvm must de-virtualize before sleep and re-virtualize after wake.

**Hypervisor VM Function Strings:**
`
VmFuncInitVmm -- Initialize Virtual Machine Monitor
VmFuncUninitVmm -- Uninitialize Virtual Machine Monitor
`

These are the top-level entry/exit functions for the hypervisor lifecycle.

### 6.3 How SimpleSvm Intercepts Denuvo's CPUID Checks

The AMD SVM hypervisor works by:

1. **Setting the EFER.SVME bit** on each CPU core to enable SVM mode
2. **Creating a VMCB** (Virtual Machine Control Block) for each core -- this is a hardware-defined data structure that controls what the hypervisor intercepts
3. **Calling VMRUN** -- this transfers control to the hypervisor. The OS becomes a "guest"
4. **On each CPUID instruction in guest mode:**
   - The CPU triggers a `#VMEXIT` -- control transfers to SimpleSvm
   - SimpleSvm examines the CPUID leaf being queried
   - For leaf 0x1: **Clears ECX bit 31** (hypervisor-present flag) before returning
   - For leaf 0x40000000-0x400000FF: Returns vendor info as if no hypervisor exists
   - For other leaves: Passes through unmodified
5. **On VMRUN in guest mode:** Injects `#GP` (General Protection Fault) -- prevents any nested hypervisor from running
6. **On EFER MSR writes:** Prevents the guest from clearing SVME bit (so it can't escape the hypervisor)

### 6.4 Certificate Dates Found

`
260226065959Z -- 2026-02-26 06:59:59 UTC
270226071959Z0 -- 2027-02-26 07:19:59 UTC
`

These are X.509 certificate validity dates embedded in the binary. The certificate was created on 2026-02-26 (2 days before the driver's file timestamp of 2026-02-28), valid for 1 year. This is a **self-signed test certificate** used for test-signing the driver.

`

**Key observations from the INF:**

1. **Name mismatch:** The INF references `hyperlog.sys` throughout, but the actual binary is named `hyperkd.sys`. This means:
   - The INF cannot install the driver through normal Plug-and-Play
   - The driver is loaded **programmatically** via `CreateService()`/`StartService()` by the game loader
   - The NFO confirms: *"The game will load the driver automatically"*

2. **Unfinished template:** Contains `; TODO:` placeholders and `<Your manufacturer name>` -- this was generated from the Visual Studio WDF Kernel Mode Driver project template and never cleaned up

3. **KMDF 1.15:** Uses Kernel Mode Driver Framework version 1.15, which requires Windows 10 version 1703 (Creators Update) or later

4. **SERVICE_DEMAND_START (3):** Not loaded at boot -- only loaded when the game needs it

5. **Root\hyperlog PnP ID:** Registered as a root-enumerated device (software-only, no hardware)

6. **CatalogFile=hyperlog.cat:** References a catalog file for driver signing -- but this file is not included in the package (unnecessary since DSE is disabled by EfiGuard)

### 7.2 Strings Extracted from hyperkd.sys -- Full Analysis

**Kernel API Imports:**
`
ntoskrnl.exe -- links to Windows kernel
ExCreateCallback -- creates callback objects
ExRegisterCallback -- registers for callbacks
ExUnregisterCallback -- unregisters callbacks
KeWaitForSingleObject -- synchronization
ObfDereferenceObject -- dereferences kernel object
ObReferenceObjectByHandle -- references object by handle
PsCreateSystemThread -- creates kernel-mode threads
PsThreadType -- thread type reference
ZwClose -- closes handle
NtQuerySystemInformation -- queries system information tables
`

**Custom Function Names (NOT kernel APIs -- internal to hyperkd.sys):**
`
VmFuncInitVmm -- Initialize the Virtual Machine Monitor
VmFuncUninitVmm -- Uninitialize the Virtual Machine Monitor
CounterThreadHandle -- Handle to the counter update thread
CounterUpdater -- The counter updating function itself
StopCounterThread -- Stops the counter thread
NotifyRoutineActive -- Flag for process notification callback
ProcessExitCleanup -- Cleanup on game process exit
`

**What these tell us:**

- `VmFuncInitVmm` / `VmFuncUninitVmm` -- hyperkd.sys **directly controls SimpleSvm.sys's hypervisor lifecycle**. It calls into SimpleSvm to start/stop the hypervisor.
- `CounterUpdater` / `CounterThreadHandle` / `StopCounterThread` -- A dedicated kernel thread that **continuously updates spoofed counter values** (likely `KUSER_SHARED_DATA.TickCount`, `QueryPerformanceCounter` values, and `RDTSC` baselines). This defeats Denuvo's timing-based anti-debug checks.
- `NotifyRoutineActive` -- Uses `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine` to monitor process creation. When `re9.exe` starts, it activates the spoofing. When it exits, it cleans up.
- `ProcessExitCleanup` -- Ensures the hypervisor is properly unloaded and KUSER data is restored when the game closes

**Scripting/VM Engine Strings (FUNC_* constants):**

The binary contains a large number of `FUNC_*` constant strings:

`
FUNC_ADD, FUNC_AND, FUNC_ASL, FUNC_ASR, FUNC_CALL, FUNC_CHECK_ADDRESS,
FUNC_DB, FUNC_DB_PA, FUNC_DD, FUNC_DD_PA, FUNC_DEC, FUNC_DISASSEMBLE_LEN,
FUNC_DISASSEMBLE_LEN32, FUNC_DISASSEMBLE_LEN64, FUNC_DIV, FUNC_DQ,
FUNC_DQ_PA, FUNC_DW, FUNC_DW_PA, FUNC_EB, FUNC_EB_PA, FUNC_ED, FUNC_ED_PA,
FUNC_EGT, FUNC_ELT, FUNC_END_OF_DO_WHILE, FUNC_END_OF_IF, FUNC_EQ,
FUNC_EQ_PA, FUNC_EQUAL, FUNC_EVENT_CLEAR, FUNC_EVENT_DISABLE,
FUNC_EVENT_ENABLE, FUNC_EVENT_INJECT, FUNC_EVENT_INJECT_ERROR_CODE,
FUNC_EVENT_SC, FUNC_EVENT_TRACE_INSTRUMENTATION_STEP,
FUNC_EVENT_TRACE_INSTRUMENTATION_STEP_IN, FUNC_EVENT_TRACE_STEP,
FUNC_EVENT_TRACE_STEP_IN, FUNC_EVENT_TRACE_STEP_OUT, FUNC_FLUSH,
FUNC_FOR_INC_DEC, FUNC_FORMATS, FUNC_GT, FUNC_HI, FUNC_HI_PA,
FUNC_IGNORE_LVALUE, FUNC_INC, FUNC_INTERLOCKED_COMPARE_EXCHANGE,
FUNC_INTERLOCKED_DECREMENT, FUNC_INTERLOCKED_EXCHANGE,
FUNC_INTERLOCKED_EXCHANGE_ADD, FUNC_INTERLOCKED_INCREMENT, FUNC_JMP,
FUNC_JNZ, FUNC_JZ, FUNC_LOW, FUNC_LOW_PA, FUNC_LT, FUNC_MEMCMP,
FUNC_MEMCPY, FUNC_MEMCPY_PA, FUNC_MICROSLEEP, FUNC_MOD, FUNC_MOV,
FUNC_MUL, FUNC_NEG, FUNC_NEQ, FUNC_NOT, FUNC_OR, FUNC_PAUSE,
FUNC_PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL, FUNC_POI, FUNC_POI_PA, FUNC_POP, FUNC_PRINT,
FUNC_PRINTF, FUNC_PUSH, FUNC_RDTSC, FUNC_RDTSCP, FUNC_REFERENCE,
FUNC_RET, FUNC_SPINLOCK_LOCK, FUNC_SPINLOCK_LOCK_CUSTOM_WAIT,
FUNC_SPINLOCK_UNLOCK, FUNC_START_OF_DO_WHILE,
FUNC_START_OF_DO_WHILE_COMMANDS, FUNC_START_OF_FOR,
FUNC_START_OF_FOR_OMMANDS, FUNC_STRCMP, FUNC_STRLEN, FUNC_STRNCMP,
FUNC_SUB, FUNC_TEST_STATEMENT, FUNC_UNDEFINED, FUNC_VIRTUAL_TO_PHYSICAL,
FUNC_WCSCMP, FUNC_WCSLEN, FUNC_WCSNCMP, FUNC_XOR
`

**This is extremely significant.** These strings come from **HyperDbg** -- an open-source hypervisor debugger project ([github.com/HyperDbg/HyperDbg](https://github.com/HyperDbg/HyperDbg)). HyperDbg is a kernel debugger that uses AMD SVM/Intel VMX to debug at the hypervisor level. The `FUNC_*` strings are the **scripting engine opcodes** used by HyperDbg's built-in scripting language.

This reveals that `hyperkd.sys` is likely **based on or incorporates code from HyperDbg**, not just SimpleSvm. HyperDbg provides:
- A complete **hypervisor-level debugger** invisible to the guest OS
- **Event injection/interception** (`FUNC_EVENT_INJECT`, `FUNC_EVENT_TRACE_STEP`)
- **Physical/virtual memory read/write** (`FUNC_DB_PA`, `FUNC_EB_PA`, `FUNC_PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL`)
- **Instruction-level stepping** invisible to the guest
- **Hardware breakpoints** managed from the hypervisor

**The `_PA` suffixed functions** (`FUNC_DB_PA`, `FUNC_DD_PA`, `FUNC_DQ_PA`, `FUNC_EB_PA`, `FUNC_ED_PA`, `FUNC_EQ_PA`, `FUNC_HI_PA`, `FUNC_LOW_PA`, `FUNC_MEMCPY_PA`, `FUNC_POI_PA`) indicate **physical address** variants -- these allow reading/writing physical memory directly, bypassing all virtual memory protections. This is critical for modifying KUSER_SHARED_DATA and other protected kernel structures.

**Denuvo Certificate Strings:**
`
Denuvo GmbH
Denuvo GmbH0
Denuvo GmbH0?
`

Same Denuvo certificate strings as in SimpleSvm.sys -- these are embedded from the game's Denuvo token/certificate data, used to identify and interact with Denuvo's protection.

**Certificate Dates:**
`
260226065959Z -- 2026-02-26 06:59:59 UTC
270226071959Z0 -- 2027-02-26 07:19:59 UTC
`

Self-signed certificate valid from Feb 26, 2026 to Feb 26, 2027.

**PE Sections:**
`
.pdata -- exception handling data (standard for x64 drivers)
.rdata -- read-only data (strings, constants, import tables)
.data -- read-write global data
.reloc -- relocation table (allows loading at any kernel address)
`

Standard PE sections for a kernel driver. No unusual sections detected.

**Unicode Wide Strings:**
`
\Callback\PowerState
`

Same power callback as SimpleSvm -- confirms hyperkd.sys manages power state transitions for the hypervisor.

**`hyperhv.dll` Reference:**
`
hyperhv.dll
`

This string references a DLL named `hyperhv.dll` -- this is **not present in the package**. It may be:
- A user-mode companion DLL loaded by the game loader to communicate with hyperkd.sys via IOCTL
- A dependency that is loaded at runtime from the game's directory
- Part of the steamclient_loader_x64.exe (not included in the workspace)

### 7.3 How hyperkd.sys Works -- Reconstructed from Strings

Based on the extracted strings, API imports, and NFO credits, here is the reconstructed operation flow:

1. **Game loader calls `CreateService()`** to register `hyperkd.sys` as a kernel service
2. **`hyperkd.sys` loads and:**
   - Detects CPU type (AMD -- SVM path)
   - Calls `VmFuncInitVmm` to initialize the hypervisor (loads SimpleSvm.sys or its own embedded hypervisor)
   - Registers `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine` callback to watch for `re9.exe` process creation

3. **When re9.exe starts:**
   - `NotifyRoutineActive` flag is set
   - `PsCreateSystemThread` creates the `CounterUpdater` kernel thread
   - The `CounterUpdater` continuously updates spoofed values in KUSER_SHARED_DATA
   - Uses `KeStackAttachProcess` to attach to re9.exe's address space for process-specific modifications
4. **While the game runs:**
   - HyperDbg-derived scripting engine runs event-based interception scripts
   - CPUID intercepts return spoofed values (no hypervisor detected)
   - RDTSC/RDTSCP intercepts return consistent timing values
   - KUSER_SHARED_DATA is continuously maintained with "normal" values
   - `KdDebuggerNotPresent` is kept set to TRUE

5. **When re9.exe exits:**
   - `ProcessExitCleanup` fires
   - `StopCounterThread` terminates the counter updater
   - `VmFuncUninitVmm` shuts down the hypervisor
   - KUSER_SHARED_DATA is restored to real values

## 8. ColdClientLoader + Goldberg Steam Emulator (Ring 3)

**ColdClientLoader Source:** Open-source -- originally by Rat431
**Steam Emulator Source:** Open-source, LGPL -- by Mr. Goldberg ([gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator))
**Purpose:** Replace the real Steam client so the game thinks it's running under a legitimate Steam installation

### 8.1 ColdClientLoader.ini -- Configuration

`ini
[SteamClient]
Exe=re9.exe # Game executable to launch
AppId=3764200 # Resident Evil Requiem's real Steam AppId
SteamClientDll=coldclient\steamclient.dll # 32-bit fake Steam DLL (16 MB)
SteamClient64Dll=coldclient\steamclient64.dll # 64-bit fake Steam DLL (17.9 MB)

[Injection]
ForceInjectSteamClient=0 # Don't force-inject -- let the game load it naturally
ForceInjectGameOverlayRenderer=0
DllsToInjectFolder= # No extra DLLs to inject
IgnoreInjectionError=0
IgnoreLoaderArchDifference=0

[Persistence]
Mode=0 # Loader exits after launching the game

[Debug]
ResumeByDebugger=0 # Normal launch, not debugger-attached
`

**How ColdClientLoader works:**
1. Sets up environment variables and registry keys that Steam games expect
2. Points `SteamClientDll` paths to the Goldberg emulator DLLs instead of the real Steam client
3. Launches `re9.exe` -- the game loads `steamclient64.dll` from the specified path
4. The Goldberg DLL responds to all Steamworks API calls locally

### 8.2 Goldberg Steam Emulator DLLs

| File | Size | Architecture | Purpose |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| `steamclient.dll` | 16,026,024 bytes | x86 (32-bit) | 32-bit Steam client replacement |
| `steamclient64.dll` | 17,895,336 bytes | x86-64 (64-bit) | 64-bit Steam client replacement (primary) |
| `GameOverlayRenderer64.dll` | 1,946,536 bytes | x86-64 (64-bit) | Steam overlay replacement |

**Strings analysis of steamclient64.dll confirmed:**
- Contains implementations of all 22 Steam interface versions listed in `steam_interfaces.txt`
- Class names found: `Steam_Client`, `Steam_Overlay`, `SteamCallResults`, `SteamCallBacks`, `RunEveryRunCB`, `Networking`, `Local_Storage`, `Settings`
- Implements every `ISteam*` interface: `ISteamClient001` through `ISteamClient022`, `ISteamFriends001` through `ISteamFriends017`, `ISteamApps001` through `ISteamApps008`, `ISteamUser001` through `ISteamUser021`, etc.
- Contains overlay rendering hooks: `DX9Hook_t`, `DX10Hook_t`, `DX11Hook_t`, `DX12Hook_t` (DirectX hooks for the fake Steam overlay)
- String `inflate 1.3.1 Copyright 1995-2024 Mark Adler` -- uses zlib for data compression
- `InGameOverlay` namespace -- implements visual overlay features
- `Friend`, `Friend_Messages`, `Announce_Other_Peers` -- LAN multiplayer emulation classes

**Strings analysis of GameOverlayRenderer64.dll confirmed:**
- Exports: `BOverlayNeedsPresent`, `IsOverlayEnabled`, `OverlayHookD3D3`
- `SteamOverlayIsUsingGamepad`, `SteamOverlayIsUsingKeyboard`
- `VulkanSteamOverlayPresent`, `VulkanSteamOverlayGetScaleFactors`
- `ValveHookScreenshots`, `ValveIsScreenshotsHooked`
- This is a **stub overlay renderer** -- provides the expected exports so the game doesn't crash when trying to initialize the Steam overlay

### 8.3 Steam Settings Configuration Files

**configs.app.ini -- Game DLC Configuration:**
`ini
[app::dlcs]
unlock_all=0 # Don't unlock all DLCs blindly (avoids detection)
3990800=Resident Evil Requiem - Grace's Costume: Apocalypse # Specific DLC
3990820=Resident Evil Requiem - Deluxe Kit # Specific DLC
`

**configs.main.ini -- Emulator Behavior:**
`ini
[main::general]
new_app_ticket=0 # Use legacy auth ticket format
gc_token=0 # No Game Coordinator token

[main::connectivity]
disable_lan_only=0 # Keep LAN-only mode
disable_networking=0 # Networking available (for LAN)
listen_port=47584 # Default Goldberg LAN port
offline=1 # *** KEY: Pretend Steam is in OFFLINE MODE ***
disable_lobby_creation=0
`

The `offline=1` setting is critical -- it makes the emulator report Steam as offline, which:
- Prevents the game from trying to contact real Steam servers
- Prevents Denuvo's online token validation from firing
- Many games have an "offline mode" code path that bypasses server-side checks

**configs.user.ini -- Fake User Identity:**
`ini
[user::general]
account_name=KIRIGIRI # Fake username (matches group name)
account_steamid=76561197960287930 # Fake Steam64 ID
language=english
ip_country=US
`

**steam_appid.txt:**
`
3764200
`
The real Steam AppId for Resident Evil Requiem.

**steam_interfaces.txt -- 22 Interface Versions:**
`
SteamClient017, SteamClient020, SteamGameServer014, SteamGameServerStats001,
SteamUser021, SteamFriends017, SteamUtils010, SteamMatchMaking009,
SteamMatchMakingServers002, STEAMUSERSTATS_INTERFACE_VERSION012,
STEAMAPPS_INTERFACE_VERSION008, SteamNetworking006,
STEAMREMOTESTORAGE_INTERFACE_VERSION016, STEAMSCREENSHOTS_INTERFACE_VERSION003,
STEAMHTTP_INTERFACE_VERSION003, STEAMUGC_INTERFACE_VERSION016,
STEAMAPPLIST_INTERFACE_VERSION001, STEAMMUSIC_INTERFACE_VERSION001,
STEAMMUSICREMOTE_INTERFACE_VERSION001, STEAMHTMLSURFACE_INTERFACE_VERSION_005,
STEAMINVENTORY_INTERFACE_V003, SteamController008, STEAMVIDEO_INTERFACE_V002
`

These tell the emulator which exact version of each Steamworks interface the game was compiled against.

### 8.4 What the Steam Layer Defeats

| Protection | How Goldberg Handles It |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Steam ownership check | Returns `true` for `BIsSubscribedApp(3764200)` |
| SteamStub (DRM wrapper) | Already removed/bypassed before the emulator loads |
| Steam user authentication | Returns fake auth tickets with the configured SteamID |
| DLC ownership | Returns `true` for the two configured DLC AppIds |
| Steam overlay | Provides stub overlay DLL that exports expected functions |
| Online connectivity | Reports offline mode -- prevents server-side validation |

## 9. amd_ags_x64.org -- AMD GPU Services Backup

**Original Name:** `amd_ags_x64.dll`
**Size:** 179,408 bytes
**Architecture:** x86-64
**PE Subsystem:** Windows Console (3) -- this is a DLL despite the subsystem
**Signed:** Yes (AMD certificate)

### 9.1 What This File Is

The `.org` extension is a common convention in game cracks meaning "original." This is the **original, legitimate AMD GPU Services (AGS) library** that shipped with the game. The crack renames it to `.org` and replaces it with a modified version (the modified `.dll` is loaded by the game but is not present in this workspace -- it would be in the game's installation directory).

### 9.2 Strings Confirming Identity

`
amd_ags_x64.dll -- original filename
Advanced Micro Devices -- publisher (AMD)
agsInitialize -- AGS initialization function
agsDeInitialize -- AGS cleanup
agsGetVersionNumber -- version query
agsCheckDriverVersion -- driver compatibility check
agsDriverExtensionsDX11_CreateDevice -- DX11 device creation with AMD extensions
agsDriverExtensionsDX12_CreateDevice -- DX12 device creation with AMD extensions
agsSetDisplayMode -- display mode configuration
D3D11CreateDevice -- standard DirectX 11 API
D3D12CreateDevice -- standard DirectX 12 API
AmdDxExtCreate11 -- AMD DX11 extension entry point
amdxc32.dll / amdxc64.dll -- AMD shader compiler DLLs
d3d11.dll / d3d12.dll -- DirectX runtime DLLs
`

This is a legitimate AMD library. It was renamed because the game loader may replace it with a patched version that removes AMD-specific DRM hooks or Denuvo integration points that use GPU hardware fingerprinting.

## 10. How All Components Work Together -- Boot-to-Game Flow

### 10.1 One-Time Setup (Before First Launch)

The user must do ONE of these before anything works:

**Option A -- Manual Security Disabling:**
1. Enter BIOS -- Enable AMD SVM (Secure Virtual Machine)
2. Run `bcdedit /set testsigning on` -- allows unsigned drivers to load
3. Run `bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off` -- disables Hyper-V's hypervisor (frees SVM for SimpleSvm)
4. Disable Secure Boot in BIOS
5. Disable Windows Defender Memory Integrity (HVCI) and Credential Guard
6. Reboot

**Option B -- EfiGuard (Automated, "the easy way"):**
1. Enter BIOS -- Enable AMD SVM
2. Copy EfiGuard files to a FAT32 USB drive at `/EFI/Boot/`
3. Boot from USB -- EfiGuard's `bootx64.efi` loads -- starts `EfiGuardDxe.efi`
4. EfiGuard automatically:
   - Patches `bootmgfw.efi` (allows modified boot chain)
   - Patches `winload.efi` (optional VBS disable)
   - Patches `ntoskrnl.exe` (disables PatchGuard + DSE)
5. Windows boots normally, but with PatchGuard and DSE silently disabled

### 10.2 Game Launch Sequence (Every Time)

Step 1: The user launches steamclient_loader_x64.exe, which is the ColdClientLoader entry point.

Step 2: ColdClientLoader reads ColdClientLoader.ini and parses the configuration, including AppId 3764200, the game executable re9.exe, and the path to the Goldberg Steam emulator DLL at coldclient\steamclient64.dll.

Step 3: ColdClientLoader sets up a fake Steam environment by writing registry keys that point to the Goldberg emulator DLLs and setting environment variables such as SteamAppId.

Step 4: ColdClientLoader launches re9.exe with the spoofed Steam environment active.

Step 5: re9.exe loads steamclient64.dll from the Goldberg emulator. Steam authentication is bypassed, the SteamStub wrapper is bypassed, and the game reports that Steam is running in offline mode.

Step 6: re9.exe's startup code detects the CPU type and checks for AMD SVM (Secure Virtual Machine) support.

Step 7: The game loader installs hyperkd.sys as a kernel service by calling CreateService with SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER type and then calling StartService. Because EfiGuard has already disabled DSE, the unsigned driver loads successfully without being blocked.

Step 8: hyperkd.sys initializes in kernel space. It calls VmFuncInitVmm() to activate the SimpleSvm.sys hypervisor on all CPU cores. The VMRUN instruction executes and Windows becomes a guest VM. CPUID interception becomes active. PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine registers callbacks for process creation and exit events. The CounterUpdater background thread starts and KUSER_SHARED_DATA spoofing begins.

Step 9: Denuvo Anti-Tamper initialization runs inside re9.exe and performs its environment checks. CPUID checks are intercepted by SimpleSvm which reports "no hypervisor present." KUSER_SHARED_DATA checks are spoofed by hyperkd.sys to show a normal OS environment. The KdDebuggerNotPresent check is patched to report no kernel debugger is attached. Timing checks using RDTSC return consistent values that do not indicate debugging or single-stepping. All environment checks pass.

Step 10: Denuvo validation passes and the game runs normally. VMProtect-obfuscated code executes without issues, Capcom Anti-Tamper checks pass, and the game is fully playable.

Step 11: When the user closes the game, ProcessExitCleanup fires in hyperkd.sys. StopCounterThread terminates the KUSER spoofing thread. VmFuncUninitVmm devirtualizes all CPU cores and shuts down the hypervisor. KUSER_SHARED_DATA is restored to its real values. The system returns to normal operation, though DSE and PatchGuard remain disabled until the EfiGuard boot entry is removed and a clean boot is performed.

### 10.3 Why Each Component Is Necessary (None Can Be Removed)

| If You Remove... | What Happens |
|-----------------|-------------|
| EfiGuard | hyperkd.sys and SimpleSvm.sys cannot load (DSE blocks unsigned drivers). If test-signing is used instead, PatchGuard detects kernel modifications -- BSOD |
| SimpleSvm.sys | No hypervisor = no CPUID interception. Denuvo detects the analysis environment -- refuses to run |
| hyperkd.sys | No KUSER spoofing, no orchestration. Denuvo's environment checks fail -- game crashes/refuses to start |
| ColdClientLoader + Goldberg | Steam APIs return errors. Game can't authenticate with "Steam" -- refuses to launch |
| amd_ags_x64 replacement | Depends on what the replacement does -- may be needed for GPU fingerprint spoofing |

---

## 11. Risk Assessment & Verdict

### 11.1 Is This Malware?

**No, this is not general-purpose malware** (not ransomware, spyware, keylogger, botnet agent, cryptocurrency miner, etc.).

Evidence supporting this conclusion:
- Every component has a specific, narrow DRM-bypass function
- Three of five components are open-source with known, audited code (EfiGuard, SimpleSvm, Goldberg)
- The `configs.main.ini` sets `offline=1` -- no outbound network connections to command-and-control servers
- The Goldberg emulator explicitly disables real Steam networking
- The crack group (MKDEV TEAM) is known in the game cracking scene -- this is their typical release format
- The NFO's instructions are consistent with DRM bypass, not malware installation

### 11.2 Real Security Risks

Despite not being malware, **the risks are serious and real:**

| Risk | Severity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| **BSOD / System Instability** | HIGH | MKDEV TEAM explicitly warns: *"Kernel drivers are able to cause blue screens when there are mistakes in the code, this has not yet been tested for long term stability."* A bug in `hyperkd.sys` at ring-0 means instant BSOD. |
| **Unverifiable Code at Ring 0** | HIGH | `hyperkd.sys` is **closed-source, 11,632 bytes of unsigned kernel code** from an anonymous group. You CANNOT verify it doesn't contain a backdoor, rootkit, or data exfiltration logic beyond what string analysis suggests. |
| **Complete DSE + PatchGuard Disable** | CRITICAL | With EfiGuard active, Windows has **zero protection against unsigned kernel drivers**. ANY other malicious driver (from a browser exploit, phishing, etc.) can now load without Windows blocking it. You've removed the castle walls. |
| **Boot Chain Modification** | HIGH | EfiGuard modifies the UEFI boot chain. If corrupted, the system may not boot. Recovery requires EFI shell access or reinstallation. |
| **HyperDbg-Based Engine** | MEDIUM | The HyperDbg scripting engine in `hyperkd.sys` provides **arbitrary physical memory read/write capability** (the `_PA` functions). This is effectively a kernel rootkit capability, even if used here only for DRM bypass. |
| **Persistent Security Regression** | HIGH | Even after closing the game, DSE and PatchGuard remain disabled until EfiGuard is removed and a clean boot occurs. The system is vulnerable the entire time. |
| **No Rollback Safety** | MEDIUM | If `hyperkd.sys` crashes mid-operation, KUSER_SHARED_DATA may be left in a spoofed state, potentially causing OS instability or other applications to malfunction. |

### 11.3 Component Trust Levels

| Component | Trust Level | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| EfiGuard | **HIGH** -- Open source, GPL-3.0, 2,300+ stars, code auditable | Well-known security research tool by a real researcher |
| SimpleSvm.sys | **MEDIUM** -- Based on open source, but **modified** by MKDEV | Original is trusted; modifications (KUSER spoof, CounterUpdater) are unverifiable |
| Goldberg Steam Emu | **HIGH** -- Open source, LGPL, widely used | Standard Steam emulator, no kernel access |
| ColdClientLoader | **HIGH** -- Open source, user-mode only | Simple process launcher/environment setter |
| hyperkd.sys | **LOW** -- Closed source, ring-0, anonymous author, HyperDbg-derived | Cannot verify; has physical memory R/W capability |
| amd_ags_x64.org | **HIGH** -- Legitimate AMD-signed library (backup copy) | Original unmodified file |

### 11.4 Summary Assessment

Classification: This is a game piracy crack, specifically a DRM bypass tool. There is no evidence of general malware behavior such as data exfiltration, ransomware, cryptocurrency mining, or botnet participation. The primary risk comes from hyperkd.sys, which is closed-source ring-0 kernel code from an anonymous author that cannot be independently verified. The secondary risk is the system-wide disabling of DSE and PatchGuard, which removes Windows' kernel-level security protections for the entire session. From a legal standpoint, this is a copyright infringement tool. The recommendation is to never run this on a primary or work machine because the security regression is too severe. If testing is necessary, use an isolated virtual machine or a spare computer that does not contain any sensitive data.
